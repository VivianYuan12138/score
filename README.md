## ðŸŒŸ Overview

**SCORE** is a lightweight LLM-based framework for evaluating and improving story coherence in AI-generated narratives. It consists of three key components:

- **Dynamic State Tracking**  
  Detects and corrects inconsistencies in the states of key items (e.g., objects that were destroyed but reappear).

- **Context-Aware Summarization**  
  Automatically generates structured episode summaries, capturing character actions, relationships, and emotional development.

- **Hybrid Retrieval**  
  Combines semantic similarity and sentiment alignment using a RAG-style approach for consistent multi-episode reasoning.
